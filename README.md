StudentMeetup
=============

### Compiling And Running
1. Configure your build path in MeetupBeans and MeetupUI.
  1. EAR Libraries
  2. JBoss 7.1 Runtime
  3. JRE System Library
  4. Web App Libraries

2. You may need to mark a "src" folder as a source folder in Eclipse in the MeetupBeans project. Otherwise, when you export the jar, the required source files will not come with it.
3. Run the server using a WAR from MeetupUI.
